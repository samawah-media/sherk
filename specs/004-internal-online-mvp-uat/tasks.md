# Tasks: Internal Online MVP UAT

**Input**: Design documents from `specs/004-internal-online-mvp-uat/`

**Prerequisites**: `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `quickstart.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, PR #17 merged to `main`.

**Status**: UAT gate task list. Hosted migration and hosted UAT execution are blocked until explicit approval.

**Scope Guard**: This branch prepares internal online MVP UAT only. It must not add product features, dependencies, database schema changes, Kanban, files, comments, approvals, social scheduling, AI, `RoleKey` changes, a standalone `project_manager` role, Production deployment, Production Supabase usage, or real client data.

**Task Format**: `- [ ] T### [P?] [Story?] Description with file path; Req; Verification; Dependencies; Category`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

1. Phase 1 must complete before documentation edits.
2. Phase 2 must complete before any hosted operation.
3. Phase 3 must complete before branch publication readiness.
4. Phase 4 is blocked until explicit owner approval.
5. Phase 5 can only publish a useful data-backed UAT after Phase 4; protected shell deployment without migration must be labeled limited.
6. Phase 6 evidence must distinguish local, hosted, blocked, skipped, and failed checks.
7. Phase 7 opens the PR and stops before merge.
