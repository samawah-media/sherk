# Tasks: Internal Online MVP UAT

**Input**: Design documents from `specs/004-internal-online-mvp-uat/`

**Prerequisites**: `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `quickstart.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, PR #17 merged to `main`.

**Status**: UAT gate task list. Vercel Hobby/free and Vercel Production hosting target are owner-approved; hosted Supabase migration, R-004 synthetic seed, Vercel Production hosting deployment, temporary synthetic sign-in activation, and authenticated browser UAT were executed on 2026-06-30 against the approved UAT target. Temporary synthetic passwords must be rotated or cleared by the owner after review.

**Scope Guard**: This branch prepares internal online MVP UAT only. It must not add product features, dependencies, database schema changes, Kanban, files, comments, approvals, social scheduling, AI, `RoleKey` changes, a standalone `project_manager` role, Production Supabase usage, real client data, or Production acceptance. Vercel Production target is allowed only as hosting.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

1. Phase 1 must complete before documentation edits.
2. Phase 2 must complete before any hosted operation.
3. Phase 3 must complete before branch publication readiness.
4. Phase 4 is blocked until a Supabase UAT project exists and receives explicit owner approval.
5. Phase 5 may publish Vercel hosting before Supabase, but data-backed UAT remains blocked and must be labeled limited.
6. Phase 6 evidence must distinguish local, hosted, blocked, skipped, and failed checks.
7. Phase 7 opens the PR and stops before merge.
