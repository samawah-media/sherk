# Evidence Checklist: Internal Online MVP UAT

Date: 2026-06-30

This checklist separates local evidence from hosted evidence. Do not mark hosted checks as passed unless they were run against the approved hosted environment.

## Hosted UAT Results - 2026-06-30

Current result:

- PR #23 is merged on `main`; R-004G branch `codex/r004-authenticated-synthetic-uat` starts from `origin/main` after merge commit `4559d14495f76af8596aad79c2afd53617855935`.
- Supabase project ref `jnvuccapgsabrwwkxnbh` resolves to `sharik-uat`, `eu-west-1`, `ACTIVE_HEALTHY`; this was treated as the approved non-production UAT target.
- Pre-migration checks found 0 auth users, 0 non-R-004 auth users, and 0 public base tables.
- `db push --linked --dry-run` listed 11 local migrations and `db push --linked` applied them to the hosted UAT target.
- `migration list --linked` now shows all 11 local migrations matched on remote.
- Only `supabase/seeds/r004_internal_online_mvp_uat.sql` was used for hosted UAT; `supabase/seed.sql` was not used.
- The hosted seed was applied through the Supabase pooler after direct database-host DNS resolution failed inside Docker.
- Post-seed counts: 5 synthetic auth users, 2 clients, 2 contracts, 2 packages, 2 package lines, 7 deliverables, 0 non-R-004 auth users, and 0 non-R-004 clients.
- Vercel project `sharik-platform` is linked and deployed to Vercel Production as hosting-only, not Production acceptance.
- Root `/` no longer exposes the F-001A placeholder; unauthenticated users are redirected to `/sign-in`, and authenticated users are routed by role/scope.
- Temporary passwords were activated for the 5 hosted `@r004.example.test` users through local in-memory environment state only; no temporary password was written to docs, git, PR text, or logs.
- Vercel public runtime env values were refreshed after non-printable BOM characters were detected in pulled values; key names remain `APP_ENV`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`; no service role env was set or printed.
- Deployment id `dpl_9vYzg7XMUAvn1Ftm38pA8SLVdnVB` is Ready with alias `https://sharik-platform.vercel.app`.
- Vercel production env key names are `APP_ENV`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`; no service role env was set or printed.
- Smoke checks for `/`, `/sign-in`, `/clients?actor=tenant_admin_a`, and `/client/commercial?actor=client_viewer_a` returned HTTP 200 and did not expose fixture client names or service-role/secret markers in HTML.
- Hosted RLS count simulation passed for scoped access: account-manager Alpha sees 1 client and 6 deliverables; Alpha/Beta client viewers each see 1 client and 0 management deliverables.
- Authenticated hosted browser UAT passed 22 assertions against `https://sharik-platform.vercel.app` using synthetic users only.
- Browser UAT covered `/clients`, `/clients/[clientId]`, `/clients/[clientId]/contracts`, `/clients/[clientId]/contracts/[contractId]/packages`, `/clients/[clientId]/deliverables`, `/clients/[clientId]/commercial`, `/client`, and `/client/commercial`.
- Browser UAT confirmed Client Alpha does not see Beta data, client viewers do not see management deliverables, and scoped internal users see only allowed data.
- Supabase CLI temp login briefly hit a pooler authentication circuit breaker after parallel RLS checks; this affected one tenant-admin simulation retry only and did not change migration/seed results.
- `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD` and `PGPASSWORD` were confirmed not set in the shell environment after hosted operations.
- Owner follow-up: rotate or clear the temporary synthetic user passwords and rotate any secrets that may have been exposed during the wider R-004 process.

## Hosted Environment Gates

| ID | Check | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| HOST-001 | Vercel account approved | PASS | `vercel whoami` reports `omarhussien2` under the owner-approved Hobby/free path. |
| HOST-002 | Protection/public exposure status recorded | PASS | Free Vercel deployment is publicly reachable; evidence records public exposure limitation before team sharing. |
| HOST-003 | Vercel env vars avoid Production Supabase/real data | PASS | Env key names reviewed; values are encrypted. No service role env exists and hosted data is R-004 synthetic-only. |
| HOST-004 | Vercel Production target hosting-only evidence | PASS | Deployment target is production, explicitly recorded as hosting-only and not Production acceptance. |
| HOST-005 | Hosted Supabase project non-production | PASS | Ref `jnvuccapgsabrwwkxnbh` resolves to project `sharik-uat`; link succeeds under the current CLI account. |
| HOST-006 | Hosted migration applied | PASS | Hosted non-production migration applied after no-real-data verification; local/remote migration lists match. |
| HOST-007 | Synthetic seed prepared | PASS | Dedicated guarded seed added at `supabase/seeds/r004_internal_online_mvp_uat.sql`; it is separate from `supabase/seed.sql`. |
| HOST-008 | Synthetic seed applied | PASS | Only `supabase/seeds/r004_internal_online_mvp_uat.sql` was applied to hosted UAT through the pooler; `supabase/seed.sql` was not used. |

## Smoke Checks

| ID | Check | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| SM-001 | Vercel URL responds | PASS | `https://sharik-platform.vercel.app/` returned HTTP 200. |
| SM-002 | Sign-in surface loads | PASS | `/sign-in` returned HTTP 200. |
| SM-003 | Hosted fixture actors disabled | PASS | Fixture query routes returned sign-in/session surface and did not expose fixture client names. |
| SM-004 | Runtime health on accepted surfaces | PASS | Root/sign-in/guarded routes returned safely; authenticated full-surface UAT subsequently passed with synthetic users only. |
| SM-005 | Browser response does not expose secrets | PASS | HTML checks found no `service_role`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, or `sb_secret` markers. |

## Security Checks

| ID | Check | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| SEC-001 | Client Alpha user cannot access Client Beta data | PASS | Hosted RLS count simulation: account-manager Alpha sees 1 client and 6 Alpha deliverables only; client viewers see one scoped client and zero management deliverables. |
| SEC-002 | Client user cannot access management-only surfaces | PASS | Client viewer Alpha and Beta each see 0 management deliverables through hosted RLS simulation; authenticated browser UAT confirmed client viewers do not see management deliverables. |
| SEC-003 | Unauthorized deliverable/SLA access denies safely | PASS | Client viewer hosted RLS simulation returns 0 deliverables without enumerating other client resources; cross-client hosted browser route attempts did not expose the other client's contract or deliverable data. |
| SEC-004 | Service role not exposed in browser | PASS | HTML scans on hosted routes found no service-role or secret markers. |
| SEC-005 | No real client data in seed/screenshots | PASS | Hosted seed/count evidence remains synthetic-only with 0 non-R-004 users/clients; no screenshots with real data were used. |
| SEC-006 | Seed refuses non-R-004 client/auth data | PASS | Seed guards abort when existing client/auth data is outside the approved synthetic R-004 fixture set. |

## UAT Checks

| ID | Surface | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| UAT-001 | Client management | PASS | Tenant admin synthetic browser UAT reached `/clients` and both synthetic clients; account-manager Alpha stayed scoped to Alpha. |
| UAT-002 | Contracts | PASS | Tenant admin synthetic browser UAT reached `/clients/[clientId]/contracts`; cross-client browser attempts did not expose another client's contract data. |
| UAT-003 | Packages | PASS | Tenant admin synthetic browser UAT reached `/clients/[clientId]/contracts/[contractId]/packages` for synthetic Alpha package data. |
| UAT-004 | Deliverables | PASS | Tenant admin synthetic browser UAT reached management deliverables; client viewers did not see management deliverables. |
| UAT-005 | Commercial summaries | PASS | Tenant admin synthetic browser UAT reached `/clients/[clientId]/commercial`; client viewers reached `/client/commercial` only for their assigned synthetic client. |
| UAT-006 | SLA MVP summaries | PASS | Authenticated hosted browser UAT covered deliverable/commercial surfaces containing seeded SLA summary data; persisted `paused_waiting_internal_decision` remains out of current schema scope. |
| UAT-007 | `paused_waiting_internal_decision` hosted persisted case | BLOCKED | Current accepted MVP has no persisted SLA segment table; covered by F-003 domain/unit evidence only until a future approved schema change. |
