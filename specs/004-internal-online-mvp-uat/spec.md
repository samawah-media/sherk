# Feature Specification: Internal Online MVP UAT

**Feature Branch**: `codex/internal-online-mvp-uat`

**Created**: 2026-06-29

**Status**: Hosted UAT evidence update - Supabase UAT migration/seed and Vercel hosting are complete; full authenticated browser UAT remains gated by synthetic sign-in credentials

**Input**: Prepare the smallest internal online UAT after PR #17, with strict AGENTS.md and Spec Kit compliance, Vercel Hobby/free allowed by owner decision, Vercel Production target allowed for hosting only, synthetic data only, no new feature scope, and hosted Supabase migration only after a real Supabase UAT project exists and is explicitly approved.

## Overview

This feature prepares Sharik for an internal online UAT pass after PR #17 (`feat(F-003): implement SLA MVP foundation`) is merged to `main`. The goal is not Production readiness. The current owner decision allows Vercel Hobby/free and allows a Vercel Production target for hosting only. This does not authorize Production Supabase, real client data, or marking Sharik production-accepted.

The UAT scope is deliberately narrow: deployed access, authentication surface, tenant/client isolation on the approved Supabase UAT target, existing client, contract, package, deliverable, and SLA MVP surfaces, and smoke/security checks. This feature must not expand into Kanban, files, comments, approvals, social scheduling, AI, background jobs, new dependencies, `RoleKey` changes, or a standalone `project_manager` role.

## Confirmed Decisions

- PR #17 was merged into `main` on 2026-06-29 with merge commit `6c406049203230c6b7e34eb0708bac0f82c981f8`.
- The UAT branch is `codex/internal-online-mvp-uat`, created from `origin/main` after PR #17.
- This feature is an internal online UAT gate, not a product feature expansion.
- Owner decision on 2026-06-30: Vercel Hobby/free is acceptable for Sharik UAT; a Vercel Production target is acceptable as a hosting target only.
- The Vercel deployment target decision does not authorize Production Supabase, real client data, or Production acceptance.
- Hosted Supabase migration is allowed only after a separate Supabase UAT project exists and an explicit approval names the project ref and confirms synthetic data only; approvals that keep `<PROJECT_REF>` as a placeholder are not valid.
- Owner later supplied project ref `jnvuccapgsabrwwkxnbh`; hosted no-real-data checks, migration, and R-004 synthetic seed completed on 2026-06-30.
- Vercel project `sharik-platform` is deployed at `https://sharik-platform.vercel.app` as Production hosting-only, not Production acceptance.
- Full authenticated browser UAT remains gated because the hosted synthetic users do not yet have an approved temporary password/sign-in path.
- No real client data, real client emails, Production Supabase project, or production data may be used.
- No dependency changes are allowed.
- No `RoleKey` changes and no standalone `project_manager` role are allowed.
- The UAT PR must not be merged without review.

## Least Internal Online MVP

The smallest online UAT that is useful and still safe is:

1. A Vercel Hobby/free deployment under the approved owner account.
2. A Vercel Production target may be used for hosting only after recording the owner decision and rollback path.
3. A separate Supabase UAT project is required before data-backed hosted checks; for this run the approved UAT project is `jnvuccapgsabrwwkxnbh`.
4. Synthetic tenant, client, user, contract, package, deliverable, and currently persistable SLA examples only after Supabase UAT is verified.
5. Smoke checks for deployed access, sign-in surface, fixture disablement in hosted runtime, build health, and no secret exposure.
6. Security checks for tenant/client isolation, unauthorized denial, role boundaries, and service role non-exposure only after Supabase UAT data exists.
7. UAT checks for existing accepted surfaces only: client management, contracts, packages, deliverables, commercial summaries, and SLA MVP summaries.
8. Evidence recorded in this Spec Kit package and `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Approve A Bounded UAT Plan (Priority: P1)

As the owner or project lead, I want a bounded internal online UAT plan before any hosted operation so that Sharik is not accidentally treated as Production or expanded beyond the accepted MVP.

**Why this priority**: AGENTS.md requires a clear Spec before code or hosted execution, and the user specifically required plan, tasks, quickstart, and data risk documentation before deploy or hosted migration.

**Independent Test**: A reviewer can read this Spec Kit package and confirm the MVP scope, out-of-scope list, environment gates, data policy, and required evidence without inspecting code.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** PR #17 is merged to `main`, **When** the UAT feature is prepared, **Then** the UAT branch starts after the PR #17 merge commit.
2. **Given** the UAT plan is reviewed, **When** hosted migration or deployment is requested, **Then** the plan shows required gates, data risks, rollback steps, and evidence targets first.
3. **Given** a requested task mentions Kanban, files, comments, approvals, social scheduling, AI, new dependencies, role changes, Production Supabase, real data, or Production acceptance, **When** the UAT scope is checked, **Then** the request is rejected or deferred outside this PR.

---

### User Story 2 - Validate An Owner-Approved Vercel Deployment (Priority: P1)

As an internal tester, I want to access an owner-approved Vercel Hobby/free deployment, optionally using the Vercel Production target for hosting only, so that I can validate the existing MVP shell now and complete data-backed checks later when Supabase UAT exists.

**Why this priority**: Online UAT is only valuable if testers can reach the app safely and the environment cannot expose Production data or unauthenticated surfaces.

**Independent Test**: A tester can open the approved Vercel URL, confirm no secrets or real data are exposed, and record which checks are smoke-only versus blocked by deferred Supabase.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Vercel deployment exists, **When** the deployment is inspected, **Then** the target, account, URL, and rollback path are recorded without secrets.
2. **Given** Supabase is deferred, **When** hosted checks run, **Then** data-backed smoke/security/UAT checks are marked `BLOCKED`, not `PASS`.
3. **Given** the hosted runtime uses deployed configuration, **When** route actor fixtures are tested, **Then** query-selected fixture actors are disabled in the hosted runtime.
4. **Given** the deployment is inspected, **When** HTML and logs are checked, **Then** service role keys, secret values, and real client data are not exposed.

---

### User Story 3 - Record UAT Evidence And Stop Before Merge (Priority: P2)

As the reviewer, I want UAT evidence recorded and the PR opened without merging so that the team can review results before accepting the internal online MVP UAT gate.

**Why this priority**: The requested outcome is a clear PR and evidence trail, not silent merge or Production release.

**Independent Test**: The PR contains the Spec Kit package, quickstart, evidence checklist, progress update, and explicit hosted operation status.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** local and hosted checks are run, **When** results are complete, **Then** `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` records the outcome, blockers, and out-of-scope items.
2. **Given** hosted Supabase migration is not explicitly approved, **When** evidence is recorded, **Then** hosted migration and dependent UAT checks are marked blocked, not passed.
3. **Given** the PR is opened, **When** reviewers inspect it, **Then** the PR clearly states it must not be merged without review.

## Edge Cases

- PR #17 is not merged or `origin/main` is stale.
- The local worktree has unrelated dirty changes.
- Vercel CLI is authenticated to the wrong account for the owner-approved Hobby/free deployment.
- The Vercel deployment uses a Production target but is mistaken for Production acceptance.
- Hosted deployment exists before Supabase UAT, so data-backed checks must remain blocked.
- The non-production Supabase project is missing required migrations.
- Hosted migration approval is not explicit enough.
- A seed script attempts to use real domains, real names, real client emails, or a hosted project that already contains non-synthetic users/clients.
- A route works locally through fixtures but fails in hosted deployment because fixtures are correctly disabled.
- A smoke check can only prove deployed shell access until hosted migration is approved.
- A tester tries to treat local evidence as hosted UAT evidence.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The team MUST verify PR #17 is merged to `main` before starting the UAT branch.
- **FR-002**: The UAT branch MUST be isolated from unrelated local work and must start from `origin/main` after PR #17.
- **FR-003**: The feature MUST define the least internal online MVP scope before hosted deployment or hosted migration.
- **FR-004**: The Vercel environment MUST use the owner-approved Hobby/free account; Vercel Production target is allowed for hosting only and MUST NOT imply Production Supabase, real data, or Production acceptance.
- **FR-005**: The UAT data set MUST be synthetic only and must avoid real client names, real client emails, production credentials, and production data.
- **FR-006**: Hosted Supabase migration MUST NOT run until a Supabase UAT project exists and explicit owner approval names that target and confirms synthetic data only.
- **FR-007**: The UAT feature MUST NOT add dependencies, product features, database schema changes, background jobs, `RoleKey` changes, or a standalone `project_manager` role.
- **FR-008**: The UAT feature MUST NOT expand scope into Kanban, files, comments, approvals, social scheduling, AI, advanced analytics, billing, Production Supabase, real data, or Production acceptance.
- **FR-009**: Smoke checks MUST cover deployed access, sign-in surface, hosted fixture disablement, build health, and no obvious secret exposure.
- **FR-010**: Security checks MUST cover tenant/client isolation, unauthorized denial, role boundary expectations, service role non-exposure, and no real client data.
- **FR-011**: UAT checks MUST cover only accepted existing MVP surfaces: client management, contracts, packages, deliverables, commercial summaries, and SLA MVP summaries.
- **FR-012**: Results MUST be recorded in this Spec Kit package and `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`.
- **FR-013**: The PR MUST be opened for review and MUST NOT be merged by the agent.

### Security And Audit Requirements

- **SR-001**: No Production Supabase project, real client data, or production data may be used. Vercel Production target is allowed only as an owner-approved hosting target.
- **SR-002**: No service role or secret key may be exposed to browser code, logs, screenshots, docs, PR text, or committed files.
- **SR-003**: Synthetic data must preserve tenant/client isolation scenarios with at least Client A and Client B.
- **SR-004**: Hosted UAT evidence must not be marked passed unless it was run against the correct hosted environment; data-backed evidence must remain blocked until Supabase UAT exists.
- **SR-005**: Cross-tenant and cross-client denial checks must avoid resource enumeration.
- **SR-006**: Any hosted mutation, migration, or seed must have rollback instructions and evidence.
- **SR-007**: The hosted UAT seed MUST refuse to run when the target contains client/auth data outside the approved synthetic R-004 fixture set.

### Key Entities

- **UAT Environment**: The owner-approved Vercel Hobby/free deployment plus a future approved Supabase UAT data backend.
- **Synthetic Data Set**: Non-real tenant/client/user/contract/package/deliverable/currently-persistable SLA records used only for UAT.
- **Hosted Migration Gate**: Explicit owner approval required before applying migrations to a non-production Supabase project.
- **Evidence Record**: A dated result for a smoke, security, or UAT check, including status and blocker if not run.
- **Review PR**: The branch publication mechanism; it is not an approval to merge.

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of hosted operation gates list the required approval, target, data policy, and rollback expectation.
- **SC-002**: The UAT evidence checklist includes smoke, security, and UAT checks with status fields for run, blocked, skipped, or failed.
- **SC-003**: The UAT scope contains no new product feature beyond accepted existing surfaces.
- **SC-004**: No real client data, real client email, Production credential, or service role value appears in committed files.
- **SC-005**: Hosted Supabase migration is either explicitly approved and evidenced, or recorded as blocked.
- **SC-006**: The PR includes a clear note that it must not be merged without review.

## Assumptions

- The approved online host is Vercel Hobby/free under the owner's account; Vercel Production target is a hosting target only.
- The approved data backend will be a separate Supabase UAT project when the owner creates one.
- Existing local evidence from F-001 through F-003 is useful context, but does not substitute for hosted UAT evidence.
- UAT testers are internal Samawah/Sharik reviewers, not real clients.
- A separate explicit approval message is required before hosted Supabase migration.
