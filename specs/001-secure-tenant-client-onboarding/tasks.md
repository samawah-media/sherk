# Tasks: Secure Tenant and Client Onboarding

**Input**: Design documents from `specs/001-secure-tenant-client-onboarding/`

**Prerequisites**: `spec.md`, `checklists/requirements.md`, `plan.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/operations.md`, `quickstart.md`, `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, `AGENTS.md`, Agent OS standards, and accepted ADRs in `docs/06-decisions/`.

**Scope Guard**: This file is a future implementation task plan only. It does not create product code, SQL, migrations, RLS policies, Supabase resources, API endpoints, dependencies, or `/speckit.implement` work.

**Tests**: TDD is required for domain/security logic: tenant isolation, client isolation, permission evaluation, invitation lifecycle, membership disabling, session behavior, audit events, enumeration-safe denials, idempotency, and rate limiting.

**Task Format**: `- [ ] T### [P?] [US?] Description with file path; Req/Contract; Verification; Dependencies; Category`

## Phase 6: Membership and Role Lifecycle

**Goal**: Tenant admin can change roles/scopes, remove client scope, revoke invitations, disable memberships, and maintain auditability/offboarding safeguards.

**Independent Test**: Change a scoped member role, remove client scope, disable membership, verify active session denial, pending invitation cancellation, responsibility transfer prerequisite, and audit.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- Phase 0 must complete before Phase 1.
- Phase 1 blocks all user-story phases.
- Phase 2 is the first recommended implementation sub-slice.
- Phase 3 depends on Phase 2 client foundation.
- Phase 4 depends on Phase 2 and shared invitation acceptance primitives from Phase 3.
- Phase 5 depends on Phase 3 and Phase 4 invitation paths.
- Phase 6 depends on Phase 5 lifecycle controls and audit foundation.
- Phase 7 depends on all role/scope states being available.
- Phase 8 depends on all selected implementation phases.

### Critical Path

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  P0["Phase 0 Project Foundation"] --> P1["Phase 1 Identity and Tenant Context"]
  P1 --> P2["Phase 2 Client Foundation"]
  P2 --> P3["Phase 3 Internal Invitation"]
  P2 --> P4["Phase 4 Client Invitation"]
  P3 --> P5["Phase 5 Invitation Lifecycle Hardening"]
  P4 --> P5
  P5 --> P6["Phase 6 Membership and Role Lifecycle"]
  P6 --> P7["Phase 7 Role-Aware Navigation and Denial UX"]
  P7 --> P8["Phase 8 Verification and Acceptance"]
```

### Security Gates

- Gate A after Phase 1: tenant/client context, permission evaluator, RLS design, safe errors, audit guard.
- Gate B after Phase 2: Client A creation cannot cross tenant/client boundaries.
- Gate C after Phase 4: client users cannot receive tenant-wide access.
- Gate D after Phase 5: invitation links cannot be replayed, superseded, mismatched, brute-forced, or reused.
- Gate E after Phase 8: zero CRITICAL/HIGH findings and full quickstart evidence.

### Parallel Opportunities

- T004-T007 can run in parallel after T001.
- T011-T015 can run in parallel after test setup.
- T026 and T027 can run in parallel with resolver implementation once shared paths exist.
- Test-writing tasks at the start of each phase marked `[P]` can run in parallel because they target different files.
- Component tests and documentation updates marked `[P]` can run while command implementation is stabilizing, after their dependencies are met.
- Do not parallelize tasks that touch `accept-invitation.ts`, invitation state machine, authorization evaluator, audit transaction guard, RLS policies, or the same command file.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First

1. Complete Phase 0 and Phase 1.
2. Implement Phase 2 only: authenticated tenant admin creates Client A with audit and isolation tests.
3. Stop and demo Client Foundation before invitations.

### Recommended First Sub-Slice

F-001A: T001-T036. This establishes authenticated tenant admin, tenant context resolver, permission evaluator, create/update client, audit, and RLS/client isolation evidence.

### Incremental Delivery

1. F-001A: Client foundation.
2. F-001B: Internal invitation and scoped internal membership.
3. F-001C: Client invitation and client membership.
4. F-001D: Invitation lifecycle hardening.
5. F-001E: Role-aware navigation, denial UX, and verification.

## Notes

- `[P]` means different files and no dependency on another incomplete task.
- Tests for sensitive behavior must be written first and observed failing before implementation.
- No Product Code, SQL, migrations, RLS policies, Supabase resources, APIs, or dependencies are created by this planning task file.
- `/speckit.implement` remains forbidden until owner approval after `/speckit.analyze`.
