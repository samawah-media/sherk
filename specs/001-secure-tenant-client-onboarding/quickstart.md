# Quickstart Validation Guide: Secure Tenant and Client Onboarding

This guide describes how to validate F-001 after implementation. It is not a full implementation guide and includes no secrets, SQL, migrations, or product code.

## Preconditions

- Local app environment is configured with placeholder development values only.
- Supabase local or development project is available.
- Samawah tenant exists as test data.
- Test users and emails are synthetic.
- Email delivery uses local capture, Supabase development email view, or a safe test inbox.
- No real client names, real emails, service-role keys, or production data are used.

## Test Accounts

| Account | Purpose | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `tenant-admin@example.test` | tenant administrator | Samawah tenant |
| `internal-a@example.test` | internal team member | Client A only |
| `client-viewer-a@example.test` | client viewer | Client A only |
| `client-b-user@example.test` | negative control | Client B only |

## Scenario Steps

### 1. Run Local Environment

- Expected Result: app loads with Arabic RTL shell and sign-in route.
- Test Account: none.
- Scope: local only.
- Audit Evidence: none required.
- Security Evidence: no secrets printed in browser or logs.
- Cleanup: stop local services after validation.

### 2. Prepare Samawah Tenant Test Data

- Expected Result: Samawah tenant is active and visible only to authorized tenant admin.
- Test Account: setup/admin fixture.
- Scope: tenant.
- Audit Evidence: fixture creation may be outside F-001; note source.
- Security Evidence: Tenant B fixture exists for negative tests.
- Cleanup: remove/reset fixtures after test run.

### 3. Create Tenant Administrator

- Expected Result: tenant admin has active tenant membership and tenant-scoped role assignment.
- Test Account: `tenant-admin@example.test`.
- Scope: Samawah tenant.
- Audit Evidence: membership/role fixture or setup audit.
- Security Evidence: no global user role used for authorization.
- Cleanup: reset membership after validation.

### 4. Sign In

- Expected Result: tenant admin enters management console.
- Test Account: `tenant-admin@example.test`.
- Scope: Samawah tenant.
- Audit Evidence: optional sign-in event; no sensitive command audit required.
- Security Evidence: active membership is checked before showing management navigation.
- Cleanup: sign out.

### 5. Create Client A

- Expected Result: Client A is created under Samawah tenant and appears in management clients list.
- Test Account: tenant admin.
- Scope: Samawah tenant + Client A.
- Audit Evidence: `ClientCreated` with actor, tenant, target client, timestamp.
- Security Evidence: creation fails for user without `PERM.CLIENT.CREATE`.
- Cleanup: archive/delete fixture only through test reset process.

### 6. Invite Internal Member

- Expected Result: pending invitation created for `internal-a@example.test` with Client A scope and internal role.
- Test Account: tenant admin.
- Scope: Samawah tenant + Client A.
- Audit Evidence: `TenantMembershipInvited` and intended `RoleAssigned`.
- Security Evidence: invitation scope is explicit; no access before acceptance.
- Cleanup: revoke unused invitation if test stops.

### 7. Accept Internal Invitation

- Expected Result: internal member activates tenant membership and Client A role assignment.
- Test Account: `internal-a@example.test`.
- Scope: Samawah tenant + Client A.
- Audit Evidence: `TenantMembershipActivated`, role assignment event.
- Security Evidence: repeated acceptance creates no duplicate membership/role.
- Cleanup: disable membership after test run.

### 8. Invite Client Viewer

- Expected Result: pending invitation created for `client-viewer-a@example.test` with exactly one Client A scope.
- Test Account: tenant admin.
- Scope: Client A.
- Audit Evidence: `ClientMemberInvited`, intended role assignment.
- Security Evidence: `client_admin` cannot perform this invite in F-001.
- Cleanup: revoke unused invitation if needed.

### 9. Accept Client Viewer Invitation

- Expected Result: client viewer enters client-facing surfaces only.
- Test Account: `client-viewer-a@example.test`.
- Scope: Client A.
- Audit Evidence: `ClientMembershipActivated`, `InvitationAccepted`.
- Security Evidence: no tenant-wide client list; no management console.
- Cleanup: disable membership after test run.

### 10. Verify Navigation

- Expected Result: tenant admin sees management clients/members/audit surfaces; internal member sees assigned client/team surfaces; client viewer sees client-facing surfaces only.
- Test Account: all test accounts.
- Scope: role-specific.
- Audit Evidence: routine navigation not required; sensitive denials audit eligible.
- Security Evidence: direct URL access is tested separately and does not rely on hidden nav.
- Cleanup: none.

### 11. Attempt to Open Client B

- Expected Result: Client A user receives safe permission denied/not found UX; no Client B data appears.
- Test Account: `client-viewer-a@example.test` and `internal-a@example.test`.
- Scope: unauthorized Client B.
- Audit Evidence: `AccessDeniedCrossClient` or equivalent sensitive denial event.
- Security Evidence: response does not reveal Client B name/existence.
- Cleanup: none.

### 12. Verify Tenant/Client Denial

- Expected Result: Tenant A user cannot access Tenant B or Client B via manual URL/resource identifier.
- Test Account: all non-authorized accounts.
- Scope: unauthorized tenant/client.
- Audit Evidence: `AccessDeniedCrossTenant`/`AccessDeniedCrossClient`.
- Security Evidence: no IDOR, no enumeration, no leaked identifiers.
- Cleanup: none.

### 13. Resend Invitation

- Expected Result: old pending invitation is superseded and new pending invitation is issued.
- Test Account: tenant admin.
- Scope: original invitation scope.
- Audit Evidence: `InvitationSuperseded`, `InvitationResent`.
- Security Evidence: old token/link cannot activate access.
- Cleanup: revoke latest invitation if not accepted.

### 14. Validate Old Link Invalidated

- Expected Result: old link returns safe superseded/unavailable message and creates no membership.
- Test Account: invited user.
- Scope: invitation scope.
- Audit Evidence: sensitive denial event for superseded invite attempt.
- Security Evidence: no scope granted; no resource existence leakage.
- Cleanup: none.

### 15. Disable Membership

- Expected Result: membership state becomes disabled and pending invitations for that membership target are cancelled according to policy.
- Test Account: tenant admin disables internal/client test user.
- Scope: target tenant/client membership.
- Audit Evidence: `MembershipSuspended` and invitation cancellation events if applicable.
- Security Evidence: no hard delete of audit history.
- Cleanup: reset fixture.

### 16. Verify Access Denied After Disablement

- Expected Result: disabled user cannot access protected resources or execute commands, even if session still exists.
- Test Account: disabled member.
- Scope: previous Client A scope.
- Audit Evidence: membership-disabled denial event if sensitive.
- Security Evidence: server-side membership state is checked on each protected path.
- Cleanup: sign out/reset user.

### 17. Verify Audit Events

- Expected Result: authorized tenant admin can review internal audit events for client creation, invitation lifecycle, role assignment, membership disablement, and sensitive denials.
- Test Account: tenant admin.
- Scope: Samawah tenant and Client A.
- Audit Evidence: event list itself.
- Security Evidence: client roles cannot read internal audit.
- Cleanup: export not required; reset local fixtures.

## Negative Validation Matrix

| Case | Expected Result |
|---|---|
| Expired invitation | no membership activated; `INVITATION_EXPIRED` safe UX |
| Revoked invitation | no membership activated; `INVITATION_REVOKED` safe UX |
| Superseded invitation | no membership activated; `INVITATION_SUPERSEDED` safe UX |
| Already-used invitation | no duplicate membership/role; safe no-op or denial |
| Email mismatch | no membership activated; `EMAIL_MISMATCH` safe UX |
| Client viewer attempts admin action | denied without revealing admin resource |
| Internal user assigned Client A opens Client B | denied without Client B data |
| Manual `client_id` tampering | ignored or denied; no access expansion |

## Acceptance Evidence Checklist

- Client A creation audit exists.
- Internal member invitation and acceptance audit exist.
- Client viewer invitation and acceptance audit exist.
- Resend supersedes prior invitation.
- Disabled membership denies access.
- Role-aware navigation matches scope.
- Cross-client and cross-tenant denials do not leak resource existence.
- RTL layout, labels, focus, and mobile invitation acceptance are usable.
- No `tasks.md`, product code, SQL, migrations, real secrets, or real client data are required by this guide.
