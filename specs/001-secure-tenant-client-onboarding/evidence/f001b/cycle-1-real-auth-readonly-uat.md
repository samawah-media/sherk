# F-001B Cycle 1 Evidence - Real Auth and Read-Only Hosted UAT

Date: 2026-06-25

Branch: `feat/f001b-staging-uat-enablement`

Base: `origin/main` at `6e8c4b0662ff362983866c49970f01d74f3576e5`

## Scope Completed

- Added Supabase SSR browser/server clients using the publishable key only.
- Added `proxy.ts` session refresh with `getClaims()` and cookie write-through.
- Added email/password sign-in, sign-out client controls, safe Arabic errors, and safe local redirects.
- Derived runtime tenant/client authorization actor from Supabase Auth claims plus database membership, client membership, role assignment, and client rows.
- Kept `?as=` route actors available for local/test only; disabled them for `preview`, `staging`, and `production`.
- Wired read-only management/client routes to runtime data while preserving local fixture-only tests.
- Updated UAT seed to Samawah tenant, Hudna client, and the three required roles without passwords.
- Archived legacy `demo-*` staging clients in the seed while preserving history; hosted read-only runtime returns active clients only.
- Added read-only runtime Data API grants with RLS still enforcing tenant/client scope.
- Applied the F-001B migration to Supabase staging project `kbntdgjzsfuqqdythmrn`.
- Applied the idempotent UAT seed to staging; verified Samawah is active, Hudna is active, and the three dummy UAT role accounts exist.
- Confirmed Vercel Preview env names are scoped to Preview and reset `APP_ENV` to `preview`.
- Continued on 2026-06-26: generated UAT passwords into local ignored `.env.uat.local`, set them in Supabase staging, and did not print credentials.
- Fixed UAT auth seed compatibility by ensuring GoTrue token fields use empty strings instead of nulls for manually seeded Auth rows.
- Hosted authenticated smoke passed on the final Preview deployment for tenant administrator, account manager, client viewer, fixture denial, direct URL denial, cross-client/archived denial, invalid session denial, and service-role non-exposure.
- Addressed CodeRabbit PR #4 follow-up by making route fixtures fail closed unless `APP_ENV` is explicitly local/development/test, keeping Playwright webserver fallback on `preview`, and adding missing read-only RLS coverage for permission references.
