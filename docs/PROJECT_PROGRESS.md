## Current Execution Gate

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Feature | F-001A Secure Client Foundation |
| Worktree | `D:\code - projects\shrek-platform-f001a` |
| Branch | `feat/f001a-secure-client-foundation` |
| Current allowed stage | A1R - Real Supabase RLS Verification |
| Status | BLOCKED |
| Next gate | A1R must become FULLY VERIFIED before A2 starts |
| Owner decision required | Install/enable WSL from an administrative PowerShell, restart Windows, then reopen Docker Desktop until `docker info` reports a running server |

## Stage Status

| Stage | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| A0 Project Foundation | COMPLETE | Existing evidence: `specs/001-secure-tenant-client-onboarding/evidence/f001a/checkpoint-a0.md` |
| A1 Identity and Tenant Context | CONDITIONALLY VERIFIED | Existing evidence: `specs/001-secure-tenant-client-onboarding/evidence/f001a/checkpoint-a1.md`; real DB verification remains blocked by A1R. |
| A1R Real Supabase RLS Verification | BLOCKED | Simulator checks pass and pgTAP database tests are prepared, but Docker Desktop cannot start its Linux engine because WSL is not installed. |
| A2 Client Foundation | NOT STARTED | Must not start until A1R is FULLY VERIFIED and owner approves crossing the gate. |

## Latest A1R Checkpoint

Commands run on 2026-06-23:

```powershell
npm run test:rls:simulator
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run secret:scan
npx supabase@2.107.0 db reset --local --no-seed
npm run test:rls:db
wsl -l -v
docker version
docker info
docker desktop status
```

Results:

- `npm run test:rls:simulator`: passed, 2 files and 7 tests.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm run lint`: passed.
- `npm run secret:scan`: passed, no high-confidence secrets found.
- `npx supabase@2.107.0 db reset --local --no-seed`: blocked at Docker daemon/pipe inspection.
- `npm run test:rls:db`: failed before assertions because the Supabase CLI could not connect to local Postgres.
- `wsl -l -v`: failed because WSL is not installed, so there is no WSL Docker fallback in this environment.
- `docker version`: Docker CLI exists at `C:\Users\omarh\AppData\Local\Programs\DockerDesktop\resources\bin\docker.exe`, but the server is unavailable.
- `docker info`: failed because Docker Desktop Linux engine is not running.
- `docker desktop status`: reports `starting`, then Docker Desktop shows WSL is not installed.

Prepared but not fully verified:

- `supabase/tests/database/a1r_rls_foundation.test.sql`
- `supabase/config.toml`
- `npm run test:rls:db`
- `npm run test:rls` now runs simulator first and then database pgTAP verification.

## Blocker

Docker Desktop is installed, but WSL is not installed and Docker Desktop cannot start the Linux engine. The local Supabase stack cannot be started and actual PostgreSQL RLS verification cannot pass until WSL is installed and Windows is restarted.

## Out of Scope Until A1R Passes

- Starting A2 Client Foundation.
- Treating simulator tests as proof of PostgreSQL RLS.
- Marking A1R as fully verified.
- Using production Supabase or real customer data.
- Merging into `main`.
