## Latest A5 Checkpoint

A5 Invitation Lifecycle Hardening completed and verified on 2026-06-24 after owner approval.

Implemented scope:

- Invitation state machine for pending, accepted, revoked, superseded, derived expired, email mismatch, already-used, and not-found decisions.
- Deterministic 7-day expiry boundary; acceptance is denied at `expires_at`.
- Idempotent accepted-link refresh for the same accepting user without duplicate memberships, roles, or audit side effects.
- Replay denial for already-used invitations by another user.
- Revoke invitation command with tenant/client scoped authorization and audit.
- Resend invitation command with supersession before replacement creation, local email dispatch capture, and audit.
- Accept-invitation hardening for expired, revoked, superseded, already-used, email mismatch, idempotency, and replay.
- In-memory rate limiter abstraction integrated into invite, resend, and accept command paths.
- Safe invitation lifecycle UI states at `/invite/[token]`.

Out of scope and not started:

- General membership/role lifecycle.
- Broad role-aware navigation.
- Deliverables, contracts, files, SLA, approvals, Kanban, and production Supabase usage.

Verification results:

- Targeted unit tests: passed, 2 files and 4 tests.
- Targeted integration tests: passed, 5 files and 11 tests.

- `npm run test:rls:db`: passed, 1 pgTAP file and 29 tests.
- `npm run test:unit`: passed, 9 files and 26 tests.
- `npm run test:integration`: passed, 10 files and 26 tests.

Implemented scope:

- Client invitation role/scope validation for `client_admin`, `client_approver`, and `client_viewer`.
- Exact one-client scope enforcement for client invitations.
- `invite-client-member` command with tenant-management authorization, client role validation, idempotent pending retry, local email dispatch capture, delivery state, and audit.
- Existing-user and new-user client invitation acceptance path that activates client membership and scoped client role assignment.
- `public.invitations` support for client invitations while preserving tenant-management-only invitation/audit RLS.
- Minimal client portal first-entry surface at `/client`.

Out of scope and not started:

- Resend, revoke, supersede, and invitation lifecycle hardening.
- General membership/role lifecycle.
- Broad role-aware navigation.

- `npm run secret:scan`: passed, no high-confidence secrets found.
- `npm run build`: passed.
- Targeted `npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/invitations/client-invite.spec.ts`: passed, 3 tests across desktop, mobile, and RTL projects.

## Latest A3 Checkpoint

A3 Internal Member Invitation completed and verified on 2026-06-24 after owner approval of commit `0966128`.

Implemented scope:

- Internal invitation role/scope validation for approved internal roles only.
- `invite-internal-member` command with tenant-management authorization, tenant/client scoped validation, local email dispatch capture, idempotent pending retry, and audit events.
- Existing-user internal invitation acceptance path that activates tenant membership and scoped client role assignments.
- `public.invitations` table for internal invitations only, with RLS enabled and tenant-management insert/read/update policies.
- Assigned internal client portfolio surface.
- Tenant-management-only read policy for internal audit events, replacing the broader active-tenant-member audit read policy.

Out of scope and not started:

- Client member invitation.
- Resend, revoke, supersede, expiry hardening beyond valid internal acceptance and simple expiry denial.
- Client portal invitation acceptance.
- Deliverables, contracts, files, SLA, approvals, Kanban, and production Supabase usage.

npm run test:rls
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:component
npm run secret:scan
npm run build
```

Results:

- First `npx supabase@2.107.0 db reset --local --no-seed`: passed after the local stack was running.
- Second `npx supabase@2.107.0 db reset --local --no-seed`: passed, proving migration replay reproducibility.
- `npm run test:rls:db`: passed, 1 pgTAP file and 15 tests.
- `npm run test:rls`: passed; simulator 2 files / 7 tests and pgTAP 1 file / 15 tests.
- `npm run lint`: passed.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm run test:unit`: passed, 5 files and 15 tests.
- `npm run test:integration`: passed, 2 files and 4 tests.
- `npm run test:component`: passed, 2 files and 3 tests.
- `npm run secret:scan`: passed, no high-confidence secrets found.
- `npm run build`: passed; Next.js production build completed.

## A1R Fixes Applied

- Added an append-only database trigger for `public.audit_events` to raise `42501` on UPDATE or DELETE.
- Corrected pgTAP `throws_ok` expectations so cross-tenant audit insert and append-only audit mutation assertions validate the actual PostgreSQL error code and message.

## Supabase Runtime Note

The local Supabase stack initially attempted to pull images from the default registry and stalled on the Postgres image. The A1R run used `SUPABASE_INTERNAL_IMAGE_REGISTRY=docker.io` and pulled `docker.io/supabase/postgres:17.6.1.136`. No production Supabase project and no real customer data were used.

## Out of Scope Until Owner Approval

- Invitation lifecycle hardening beyond A3 internal valid acceptance.
- Invitation lifecycle hardening beyond A4 client valid acceptance.
- Membership/role lifecycle.
- Broad role-aware navigation.
- Production Supabase usage.
- Real customer data.
- Merging into `main`.
